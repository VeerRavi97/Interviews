(C Programming MCQs): 
Output finding questions from topics like pointers, 
switch case(what if ‘case’ is written inside an ‘if ‘ condition),
data types, functions, linked list based fill in the blanks code snippets, and some vague questions.

 All questions were from basic computer science topics like OS(synchronisations, memory management), 
 Computer Organisation(set associative Cache memory: tag memory space finding questions), 
 DBMS(1 question was from B+ tree), SQL queries, and basic data structures and algorithms(time complexity etc)


Mainly outputs of C codes were asked. Clear concepts of pointers is required. Practice from  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-language-2-gq/pointers-gq/
and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-language-2-gq/advanced-pointer-c-gq/



Many output based questions, object oriented concepts(interfaces, classes),
pointers, operator precedence, scope and lifetime of variables, storage classes related questions.

THERE IS NEGATIVE MARKING IN THIS ROUND
